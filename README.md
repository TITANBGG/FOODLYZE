🧠 Technologies Used

Foodlyze leverages modern mobile and cloud technologies to ensure fast performance, scalability, and seamless user experience:

Android Studio – Official IDE for Android development

Kotlin / Java – Robust languages for scalable and readable code


Firebase Suite:

Authentication – Secure login and user management

Realtime Database & Firestore – Storage for scanned product history and user preferences

Firebase Storage – For storing scanned image previews

Google ML Kit Barcode API – For accurate and fast barcode detection

Open Food Facts API – Open-source food product database used for detailed nutritional and ingredient information

Jetpack Libraries – LiveData, Navigation Component, ViewModel for lifecycle-aware architecture

Retrofit – For efficient REST API communication

Gson – For parsing JSON data from APIs


🌟 Innovation & Social Impact

Foodlyze addresses a real-world problem: lack of transparency in packaged food. While most people check calorie counts, very few understand what ingredients like E250 or sodium nitrate truly mean. Foodlyze decodes these terms in real-time, making food literacy accessible to everyone.

Key Contributions:

Promotes healthier eating by helping users avoid harmful additives

Supports individuals with food allergies by providing instant detection and warnings

Empowers informed decision-making in grocery shopping

Enables parents to make safer food choices for children

Bridges the information gap in food labeling

By encouraging responsible food consumption, Foodlyze contributes to long-term public health awareness and builds user trust in technology-driven wellness tools.
